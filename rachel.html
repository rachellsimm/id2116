   <h1>Hi My name is Rachel Sim</h1>
   <p>Polytechnic experience in design has allowed me to gain knowledge and allowed me to find passion in the work that I do. 
     Design has always been something that I feel strongly for, from the hands-on making to the graphical side to the thinking, intriguing me with every projects/submissions that I receive. 
     I take pride in the work that I do and am always happy to share my works with people around me, spreading the story and meaning behind every product/experience.
   </p>

   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are that </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Strength01 : I love to experiment with colours. I enjoy seeing different colours come together to create a story, giving people that visual impact.
        Colours has always been 'something' that i carry around with me - i have multiple colours of highlighters, i love to use colour to organise and create a story with colours. 
      </li>

      <li>Strength02 : My second strength as a designer would be that i enjoy experimenting with materials and being hands on with products. 
        I feel that this type interaction with products/materials gives me that sense of connection and it allows me to develop more and explore further with being hands on.
      Being hands on while ideating allows me to visualise my idea firsthand and also tell me if my idea is feasible. </li>

      <li>Strength03 : My third strength would be design thinking? I love the idea of constantly exploring for endless possibilities and also searching to gain more knowledge of things that make me curious.
        I think in the form of experience design? I enjoy putting myself into the shoes of the user when they use the product or enjoy the space so that i understand what is really needed formt he point of view of the users. </li>
      <li>Strength04</li>
    </ul>
