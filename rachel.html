   <h1>Hi My name is Rachel Sim</h1>
   <p>Polytechnic experience in design has allowed me to gain knowledge and allowed me to find passion in the work that I do. Design has always been something that I feel strongly for, from the hands-on making to the graphical side to the thinking, intriguing me with every projects/submissions that I receive. I take pride in the work that I do and am always happy to share my works with people around me, spreading the story and meaning behind every product/experience.
