   <h1>Hi My name is Rachel Sim</h1>
   <p>I am a direct Year2 student from Singapore Polytechnic. Polytechnic experience in design has allowed me to gain knowledge and allowed me to find passion in the work that I do. 
     Design has always been something that I feel strongly for, from the hands-on making to the graphical side to the thinking, intriguing me with every projects/submissions that I receive. 
     I take pride in the work that I do and am always happy to share my works with people around me, spreading the story and meaning behind every product/experience.
   </p>

   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are that </h2>
    
      <li>Strength 01 : I love to experiment with colours. I enjoy seeing different colours come together to create a story, giving people that visual impact.
        Colours has always been 'something' that I carry around with me - having multiple colours of highlighters, I love to use colour to organise and create a story with colours. 
      </li>

      <li>Strength 02 : My second strength as a designer would be that i enjoy experimenting with materials and being hands on with products. 
        I feel that this type interaction with products/materials gives me that sense of connection and it allows me to develop more and explore further with being hands on.
      Being hands on while ideating allows me to visualise my idea firsthand and also tell me if my idea is feasible. </li>

      <li>Strength 03 : My third strength would be design thinking? I love the idea of constantly exploring for endless possibilities and also searching to gain more knowledge of things that make me curious.
        I think in the form of experience design? I enjoy putting myself into the shoes of the user when they use the product or enjoy the space so that i understand what is really needed formt he point of view of the users. </li>

      <li>Strength 04 : Lastly, I would not consider this as a strength as I feel that i have yet to be exposed to this area of design yet but I am very interested in spacial design. How space affect how the user would feel.
        I came across spacial design together with a touch of service design and it opened up another whole new interest in design for me. I think that coming into NUS ID I would like to take up a project on spacial and experience design to give it a shot.
         This is more of a fun fact of me because I can't think of anymore strengths that I have.
      </li>
